Hi I'm tbaggeroftheuk

I am home schooled and I am a NERD. I like homebrew and coding and an currently making a point and click game in C++ :D.

Languages I know 

- python (after C I hate it)
- Lua (slightly better python) 
- C (a nightmare to make a dynamic string) 
- C++ (My beloved) 
- php (it's C++ with more $)
